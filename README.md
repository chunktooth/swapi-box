## About
Starwars fans/enthusiasts rejoice! Here users can browse information about Starwars based on 3 different categories- People, Planets and Vehicles, with a feature to save/ unsave each card as favorites for later viewing.

## Specs
This project was made with React.js framework, first time implementing Async-await to fetch API, also React-router to navigate through the app.

## Challenges
Fetching a nested array within an object, especially from a large dataset could become cluttered and easily mislocated, also the page may lag and take some time to load. Testing API fetch is still a fairly new concept to me.

## Wins!
Created a dynamic children component, favorite card toggling, clean data for particular display of info, iconic opening text crawl thanks to an online CSS community and a code snippet for glowing effect on each button hover state.
